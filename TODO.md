- [x] If a cell is full, players should not be able to play there
- [x] If a subgrid has a draw, players should not be able to play there
- [ ] If a player is directed to a completed (drawn or won) subgrid, the player should instead be
      allowed to play on all subgrids
- [x] The player should not be able to play on subgrids they are not directed to
- [x] The player who is currently playing should be displayed
- [x] The "x" and "o" characters should be placed in the center of cells or replaced with another method of
      displaying who's playing (colored squares are used in the bejofo edition of the game; perhaps that'd be
      a good method to adopt here?)
