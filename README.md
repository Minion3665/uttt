# Final evaluation
## Is it working as intended?
Yes, the game works as intended.

## Can you get back to your code and understand it?


## Should the code be refactored? Have you applied DRY? Separation of concerns?
Yes, the code should be refactored. I have ~50 minutes left until I need to submit this, so I will try refactoring to better separate concerns before that time is up.

## Have you commented it? Are the names of the components/variables meaningful?
My components and variables are meaningfully named. I haven't written any comments; I may write comments about *why* certain parts are used (but not what the code does) before submission.

## What would you do if you had to start over?
I would structure it differently such that a noughts and crosses cell was able to hold a grid inside of it. Right now, there's 2 separate ways of making a grid and I feel that this could be made with less repetition using a recursive approach.

## What have you learnt?
I've used cookies in react functions for the first time, and come across some hurdles to do with that and hydration.
